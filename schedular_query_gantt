Let me examine this workflow image closely to extract the details.The image is very wide and the text is extremely small at this zoom level. Let me try to extract it programmatically to get the details.I can see the workflow but the text is still quite blurry even at 6x zoom due to the original image resolution being only 2000x205 pixels. However, I can make out the color-coded workflow stages and cross-reference them with the client requirement doc and DB metadata I already have.

Let me be honest with you — the image resolution is too low to reliably read the column names from the workflow boxes. The original image is only **2000×205 pixels** for a very wide diagram, which means each text label is just a few pixels tall.

That said, based on what I **can** make out from the workflow (the color-coded stages, milestone numbers, and flow sequence) combined with the **client doc** and **DB metadata** you already shared, here are the columns for each pre-requisite:

**Can you re-upload the workflow image in higher resolution?** The current one is 2000×205 pixels — if you have the original (likely 8000+ pixels wide), I'll be able to read every box label and confirm if there are additional columns or milestones I'm missing. You could also try exporting it as a PDF or zooming into specific sections and screenshotting those.
